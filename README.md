# knights-odyssey-dungeon-crawler
A 2D Java Game where the player finds themselves in a sandy dungeon and has to find as many coins as possible.

How To Play:  
-Move around using the WASD keys  
-Use Q and E to zoom in and out, which is helpful for keeping track of the chests around the map  
-Interact with objects and fire your weapon with the left click button on your mouse  
-Don't come in contact with ANY monsters and try to collect as many coins before you die  
-Good Luck!  

Differences in Original Design:  
-I planned on having multiple levels, now I just have a single arena  
-I wanted to have potions to give upgrades to the player  
-No combat mode that restricts zoom  

Additional Functionalities:  
-Different kinds of enemies  
-A spinning axe that came back to the player  
-Cool cutscenes and dialogue  
-Coins in the chests to count points  

Known Bugs/Erros:  
-When walking against a wall and you squish into another wall, you disable movement for both directions. When coming off of the second wall, you will not be allowed to move back provided you stay on the wall  
-When moving/on high zoom and opening chests the coins may fly away  
-When two boundaries collide specifcally it may block the player's movement for a little  

Additional Notes:  
-Tip: Stay away from the Ogres, they are very strong!  
-Other than that, have fun! Shouldn't be too hard.
